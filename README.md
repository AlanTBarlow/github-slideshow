# GitHub Slideshow

This project was originally a [**GitHub Learning Lab**](https://lab.github.com) course titled [*"Introduction To GitHub"*](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) and is based on the [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) open source project. The course was completed then modified by [**me**](https://github.com/alantbarlow) to personalize the project and create a better slideshow.

## Project Purpose

This project is a simple slideshow that lets me introduce myself. It consists of a few different slides that lets you get to know me better and provides links to other networking sites.

## Project Usage

Switching between slides is simple. You can use either the arrows on your keyboard or the ones displayed on the screen to move back and forth between screens. To view the slideshow go to [*alantbarlow.github.io/github-slideshow*](https://alantbarlow.github.io/github-slideshow).
